# Task Inbox

A simple list of things to do. The daily schedule compiler pulls from here.

## Inbox

- [ ]

## How This Works

1. **Add tasks here** as they come up (or sync from Apple Reminders)
2. **Daily schedule compiler** reads this and asks which ones to prioritize
3. **Mark complete** when done
4. **Incomplete tasks** roll over to the next day automatically

## Tips

- Keep tasks small and actionable ("Email John" not "Figure out partnership strategy")
- Add context if helpful ("Email John — he asked about pricing")
- Don't worry about organizing — the compiler helps you prioritize each day
- If something sits here for weeks, either do it or delete it

*This is your inbox, not your to-do list. The daily schedule is your to-do list.*
